# weather-widget

## Brief
A quick weather widget using React / Redux and SASS. Uses API from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)
Only uses free API to obtain reports for every 3 hours and filters are provided for quick checks.

## Development

It uses yarn as package manager. Clone the repository, and

```
yarn
```

Start the server by:

```
yarn start
```

Lint the code by:

```
yarn lint
```

Build the files by:

```

```


## Issues
API in backend
More interactive UI
